# 5 Factors
## 1st Factor: Momentum - Befriending the Trend
 

## 2nd Factor: The Economy - Headwind or Tailwind
 - Over long periods of time, what happens in the stock market reflects economic activity
 - crucial economic metrics are the shapes of two different curves:
    - yield curve: 
        * When the yield curve taeks positive slope (where there is a gap between the yield on the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year  Treasury note of molre than 2%), that yield spread telss me that economic backdrop is generally bullish for stocks
        * A steep yield curve (one where the slop goes up dramatically) signals strong economic growth. That is potentially a great stock market environment so long as the growth doesn't get to the point where inflationary pressures tempt Federal Reserve monetary policy authorities to get into the act and choke it off by raising interest rates
        * One of the best predictors of the economy's health is the spread between th 3-month Treasury bills and the 10-year Treasury notes. When that yield curve inverts, that is, when the yields investors can earn on 10-year Treasurys are lower than those on shorter-term securities, the yield curve is telling me that investors expect an economic slowdown.
        * One of the best things to do is to track what happens to the yields on both the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes. If the latter is higher than the 2-year yield, the economy is expanding. If the 10-year yield is lower than the 2-year yield, it's an economic contraction.
        * One of the risks associated with an economic expansion is that the expansion will overheat and turn into inflation. 
        * A flat to inverted yield curve suggests that the Fed is more likely to lower key lending rates, and that the business environment is benign. 
    - federal funds futures curve:
        * The steeper the curve, the greater the likelihood that interest rates will be higher in the future, creating a headwind that companies must confront.
    - Conference Board's Composite Index of Leading Indicators
        * It tracks ten components, ranging from the number of new building permits issued to the average number of hours worked weekly in the manufacturing sector (and including the yield differential between the 10-year Treasury note and the Federal funds rate) and wraps them up in one neat package. 
        * When the rate of change in this index hovers above 0.1 for 3 months in a row, the economic outlook seems positive
        * Not as reliable a predictor as the shape of the yield curve
 - Global market: If the business cycle in the US has peaked and is beginning to contract, the logical next step is to look abroad in search of a region where the economy is expanding.
    * As a broad rule of thumb, any stock portfolio should consider having a third of its capital invested outside the US.

## 3rd Factor: Liquidity - Follow the Money
 - Liquidity metrics:
    - Value of Japanese yen:
        * Because hedge funds tended to borrow money by shorting yen, a rise in the yen's value would tell that hedge fund borrowing was falling.
    - Credit spread changes: 
        * A credit spread is a key concept in finance that measures the difference in yield between two bonds of similar maturity but different credit quality. In simple terms, it tells you how much extra return investors demand for taking on credit risk.
        * Credit Spread = Yield of corporate/credit risky bond − Yield of risk-free bond (e.g., Treasury of same maturity), 1 bps = 0.01%
        * What It Measures
            * Default risk premium → The additional compensation for the chance the issuer defaults.
            * Liquidity premium → Less liquid bonds often have wider spreads.
            * Market sentiment → Spreads widen in risk-off periods (recession, market stress) and narrow in risk-on periods.
        * Risk Indicator: Wider spreads → investors perceive higher credit risk, and widening spreads would warn that lenders were becoming more cautious 
 - How to track the liquidity of US stock market?
    1) Macro liquidity
        - Fed balance sheet (QE vs QT): These tell you whether financial conditions are loosening or tightening
            * WALCL (Total Fed assets) – FRED: 
                * ↑ WALCL → liquidity tailwind
                * ↓ WALCL (QT) → liquidity headwind
        - Reverse Repo (RRP): High RRP = excess cash parked at Fed, not in markets
            * RRPONTSYD – FRED
                * RRP ↓ → cash released into markets (bullish liquidity)
                * RRP ↑ → liquidity drain
        - Treasury General Account (TGA): Treasury spending injects liquidity; rebuilding TGA drains it
            * WTREGEN – FRED
                * TGA ↓ → bullish for equities
                * TGA ↑ → bearish liquidity impulse
        - Net liquidity: Used by hedge funds, most powerful single metric
            * Net Liquidity=Fed Assets−RRP−TGA
                * When this rises → stocks usually follow with a lag
    2) Market confirmation
        - VIX
            * Low & stable VIX → liquidity abundant
            * VIX spikes → liquidity withdraws
        - Credit spreads (HYG)
            * Tight spreads = risk-on liquidity
            * Widening spreads = liquidity retreat
        - Small caps vs SPX
            * Small caps outperform when liquidity is plentiful
        - Volume breadth
